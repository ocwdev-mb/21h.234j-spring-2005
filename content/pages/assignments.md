In addition to doing the readings, coming to class, and joining in the discussion, each student is expected to write a substantial research paper on a topic of his or her choice that deals with downtown, its past or its present, and relies largely on primary sources. Two of the final papers from the class are presented here. All work is courtesy of the student named and used with permission.
